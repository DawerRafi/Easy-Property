APPLICATION OVERVIEW:

Easy Property provides an online portal for property sellers and buyers to interact with each other all in the comfort of a single click. The whole Application is web-based and all data is maintained (uploaded & retrieved) in the database hosted. The application caters to two distinct approaches namely, the buyer (Normal User) and the seller (Agent).

An Agent:
    Any user who wishes to post an ad for a property can Sign up as an Agent by giving their Office Address, Contact Info and other personal information. Once registered, he/she can add property, change their account information, change their password and edit information for their already existing property. She/he can also upload photo for their property (Under Edit Property Option).

A Normal User:
    Any person who just wishes to view information provided by agents are considered as a "Normal User". This user can open their application and search for properties that are currently residing in the database of the application.

    On hitting the search button the user will be given a choice to get all the properties in the specified area OR to get all the Agents who currently are dealing with properties of the specified area.

    The user can further view all properties by a specific agent, view agent info, view property info/pictures, rate the agents by giving reviews and can even read reviews given by other people.
